# interactive-card

summery:
The interactive card project was one of the more challenging projects i have worked on up into the point.
The challenging parts for me were the layering of all the changing numbers and backgrounds.

processes and tools used:
*html
*css
*sass/scss
*grid
*javascript
*git

continued development
Would like to rework the javscript for a more rebust error catching when collecting information.
In the future Iwould like to redo the project in react
